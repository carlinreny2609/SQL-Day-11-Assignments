Functions:
----------

A function is a specialized type of stored program designed to return a single value. Typically, you use
stored functions to encapsulate common formulas or business rules, making them reusable across SQL
statements or other stored programs.

- Cannot perform transactions (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- Only input parameters are allowed.
- No exception handling with TRY…CATCH.



procedure:
-----------

A stored procedure is a block of SQL code that can perform multiple operations and may or may not return values.

- Can return zero, one, or multiple values.
- Supports both input and output parameters.
- Can include DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- Allows exception handling (TRY…CATCH).

Functions are lightweight and in-line with queries, while procedures are heavier but more powerful.
